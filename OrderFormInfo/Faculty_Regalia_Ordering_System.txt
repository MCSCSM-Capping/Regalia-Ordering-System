Faculty Regalia Ordering System


  The Marist college registrar team is responsible for (among a lot of other things) taking the orders from
  the faculty each year for their caps/gowns (aka the Regalia). Currently this is a paper based system.
  Information is gathered via emails or paper printouts of a form that requests information such as which
  school the faculty graduated from for their highest degree, what degree they hold, what hat size, what
  robe size, etc. It also allows faculty to order generic ‘black’ robes instead of the robes from their school.


  Your job is to create a web-app (adaptive) that allows faculty to place these orders, view their order,
  renew their order preferences each year. It should store all the information for each faculty member in a
  database that also stores information about when the order is reviewed or changed. It should also
  provide the registrar with a report of those faculty who have not placed an order, and a listing of those
  who have failed to renew / review their orders each year.


  It would be nice to build into the system a way to generate reminder emails.

  The system must be extensible, easy to understand, SUPER easy to use, well documented, easy to
  maintain and deployed on the Marist network before the end of the semester so that all faculty can
  access it and use it.
